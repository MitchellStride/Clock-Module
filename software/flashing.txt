Insert while holding USB Boot, RP Drive should be connected.
Download latest .uf2 file > https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/
Drag and drop onto RP drive
Should disappear as a usbdrive and reappear as a COM port

Now we can run code temporarily
Or boot as usbdrive and save it as main.py to autorun on boot
Try name boot.py to have it run once before main.py
	This works better, on Thonny > Stop backend > Save As > Pico > main.py


VSCODE default is autoconnect which can interrupt running main.py so close or change this 
	to have code run automatically

Or use thonny, set Tools > Interpreter > MicroPython (RP2040 or Pico)

Uploading Custom Libs:
Then don't usb boot, regular mount to COM3 etc. We need 2 upload any custom libs to the pi under /lib/example.py
So on thonny do Tools > Manage Packages > Search or upload it there
